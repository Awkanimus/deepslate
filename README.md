Deepslate
=========

This mod adds deepslate and related building materials.

Deepslate is a type of stone that can be found deep underground.
It can be crafted into bricks, blocks, tiles, and pillars for building.

Ores and dungeons in the deepslate layer will generate as deepslate variants.

By default, deepslate starts generating below -768, and replaces all stone
below -1024. This can be changed in the settings.
